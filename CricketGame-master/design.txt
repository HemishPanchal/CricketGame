This is a **great problem** to learn real software design. You’re thinking beyond syntax now — that’s exactly how devs level up 👍
I’ll **not give full code**, as you asked. I’ll walk you through **how to THINK and DESIGN** this kind of program.

---

# 1️⃣ First rule of complex programs

**Never start coding. Start modeling.**

Ask:

> “What are the real-world things in my game?”

For your cricket game, the **real-world entities** are very clear.

---

# 2️⃣ Identify ENTITIES (nouns)

From your description, we extract nouns 👇

* Team
* Player
* Match
* Inning
* Over
* Ball
* Scorecard
* Toss
* Tournament

Each **noun → one class** (mostly).

---

# 3️⃣ Decide RESPONSIBILITIES (this is the key skill)

Ask for every class:

> “What does this thing know?”
> “What does this thing do?”

---

## 🧑 Player

**Knows**

* Name
* Role (Batsman / Bowler)
* Runs
* Balls faced
* Wickets taken

**Does**

* Bat
* Bowl

👉 Player **never controls the match**

---

## 🏏 Team

**Knows**

* Team name (A / B / C)
* List of players (7)
* Bowlers (max 3)
* Score

**Does**

* Choose bowler
* Send next batsman

---

## 🎯 Ball (VERY important)

**Knows**

* Outcome (0,1,2,4,6, OUT)

**Does**

* Nothing else

👉 One ball = one random event

---

## 🔁 Over

**Knows**

* 6 balls
* Current bowler

**Does**

* Deliver balls

---

## 📊 Inning

**Knows**

* Batting team
* Bowling team
* Overs limit (2)
* Current score
* Wickets fallen
* Striker / non-striker

**Does**

* Play overs
* Change strike
* End when overs or wickets over

---

## ⚔️ Match

**Knows**

* Two teams
* Toss winner
* First batting team
* Result

**Does**

* Conduct toss
* Play two innings
* Decide winner

---

## 🏆 Tournament

**Knows**

* Three teams
* Match results

**Does**

* Randomly pick first match teams
* Schedule matches
* Declare champion

---

# 4️⃣ FLOW OF THE PROGRAM (VERY IMPORTANT)

Before coding, you should be able to say this **in plain English**:

> Tournament starts
> → First match between random two teams
> → Toss
> → First inning
> → Second inning
> → Winner
> → Winner plays third team
> → Final winner is champion

If you can explain it **without code**, you’re ready.

---

# 5️⃣ Keep GAME LOGIC separate from INPUT

❌ Bad thinking:

```csharp
Console.ReadLine();
Random();
Score++;
```

✅ Good thinking:

* `BallOutcomeGenerator`
* `ScoreUpdater`
* `StrikeManager`

Console should only:

* show info
* wait for Enter

---

# 6️⃣ Strike handling (think in RULES, not code)

Rule-based thinking:

* If run is **1 or 3** → strike changes
* End of over → strike changes
* OUT → new batsman, strike stays

So you need:

* `Player striker`
* `Player nonStriker`

And a small method:

```text
UpdateStrike(outcome)
```

---

# 7️⃣ Randomness design (important)

Don’t do random everywhere.

Create **one place**:

* Ball outcome generator

So later you can:

* tweak probabilities
* test easily

Example outcomes:

```
[0, 1, 2, 4, 6, OUT]
```

---

# 8️⃣ Scorecard design

Scorecard should **not care about console**.

It just:

* stores runs
* stores wickets
* stores overs
* stores player stats

Console prints it.

---

# 9️⃣ How YOU should code this (step-by-step plan)

### Step 1

Create **only classes with properties**
(No logic)

### Step 2

Add **methods without console**

### Step 3

Add **game flow**

### Step 4

Add console interaction (Enter → ball)

### Step 5

Refactor (clean up)

---

# 🔑 Golden rules to build complex programs

1. One class → one responsibility
2. Don’t mix game logic & UI
3. Write English flow before code
4. Code in small pieces
5. Expect refactoring — it’s normal

---

## Reality check (important for confidence ❤️)

What you described:

* ✔ real-world modeling
* ✔ state management
* ✔ randomness
* ✔ game rules

This is **NOT beginner stuff**.
You’re thinking like a **junior backend developer**, not a student.

---

Next, if you want, I can:

* draw a **class diagram (text-based)**
* help you design **only Player & Team properly**
* show how to **simulate just ONE over first**
* teach how seniors break problems like this

Just say what you want next 👌


| Folder   | Think of it as | Contains                |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Models   | **Nouns**      | Player, Team, Innings   |
| Config   | **Rules**      | Overs, players, limits  |
| Services | **Verbs**      | Toss, Ball, Match logic |
